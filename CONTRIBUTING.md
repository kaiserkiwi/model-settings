# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to my package

You can contribute in the following ways:

- Finding and reporting bugs 
- Contributing code to the package by fixing bugs or implementing features 
- Improving the documentation

Please keep in mind, that this package is meant to be extremely simple and lightweight. There are some package out there that can do much more than this package, but this is actually the point. So if you want to make a change that makes the package more complex, please consider if this is really necessary.

## Pull Requests
### Size and Scope
My time is limited and PRs making large, unsolicited changes are unlikely to get a quick response. Changes which link to an existing confirmed issue, or which come from a "help wanted" issue or other request are more likely to be reviewed much quicker.

The smaller and more narrowly focused the changes in a PR are, the easier they are to review and potentially merge. If the change only makes sense in some larger context of future ongoing work, note that in the description, but still aim to keep each distinct PR to a "smallest viable change" chunk of work.

### Description of changes
Please include a description of the changes you are making in the PR. This should include:
- What was changed 
- Why it was changed
- How it was changed
- Any other relevant information

Before submitting a PR, please make sure that you run `./vendor/bin/pint` before your last commit. This will ensure that your code is formatted correctly and follows the coding standards of the package.
